This is a keylogger worm virus for Windows computers. This was packaged into an executable file using PyInstaller. To run it, copy the
files start.bat and loveMachine.exe and run start.bat

After every 1000 characters typed on the computer, the virus copies itself to a random location on the hard drive and deletes older copies.
It also sends an email to the email address specified with the content being the letters typed and the subject being the computer ID it 
was sent from.

This virus doesn't have permancence and will stop running after your computer is shut down. It will run "silently" but you can end the PID
task by the name of loveMachine.exe

The name of the virus is a reference to the Summer Wars anime movie.
